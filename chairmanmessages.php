						Through the efforts of our accomplished faculty, our talented students and exceptional alumni, we have been able to make rapid progress on our path of continuous growth and innovation. These accreditations and recognitions make us confident that we can be among the best institutions in the India by 2030.						</p>
						<p>
						AIT is committed to nurturing leaders and entrepreneurs who will empower their organizations in the global economy. At the same time, the Institute remains deeply rooted in the region and the nation. An underlying priority is to instill in our students a sense of commitment as managers to have a socially responsible impact; to give them an understanding of how difficult and challenging this often can be; and to expand their knowledge and their intellectual horizons so they emerge transformed and prepared to have an impact on the world of business and society at large. We have consciously created a culture that values collegiality and accessibility, with open doors at all levels.</p>
						<p>
						On the bedrock of our core values, we will continue to scale up over the next decade to build a management institute of international repute.						</p>
