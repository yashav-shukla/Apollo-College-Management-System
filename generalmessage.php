						Apollo has emerged as a leading world class educational group that creates and disseminates knowledge, integrating advance technology. It was always a dream to build a conglomerate of institutions for quality, innovation and eminence to create graduates with knowledge and competence that can help in scripting success stories.						</p>
						<p>
						We focus on participation of our students in academics, teaching, cultural, social and physical activities to make them socially sensible all-rounder</p>
						<p><b>Let me list a few practices of Apollo that are on top of the radar:</b></p>
						<ul>
<li class="apt-2021">Leveraging the intellectual and emotional bandwidth resident here in the faculty and student community, essential to spawn tomorrowâ€™s global leaders today.</li>
<li class="apt-2021">Ensuring an unshakable commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive community of learners, driven by values and energized by the meritocracy that marks our institute.</li>
<li class="apt-2021">Sustaining an open and transparent culture that stokes curiosity at every turn, encourages collaboration and gets the best out of every student.</li>
<li class="apt-2021">Preparing students for the complex world that they will face when they leave the portals of this vaunted institute leveraging our close linkages with industry, the Government and of course the academia. A complex world where they will have to take a position, express opinion, shape it and lead to make it a better place.</li>
<li class="apt-2021">Building a responsive and powerful community of alumni in India and abroad who are global names to reckon with and are engaged meaningfully with the institute.</li>
</ul>
