						AIT is a proud mission driven community providing a world class education, celebrating the fact that each student is different, as a person and as a learner. I believe that powerful learning and teaching occurs under a shared spirit of respect which creates a passionate professional experience recognized for its warmth, energy and excellence.</p>
						<p>
						We foster a positive spirit and believe in partnership between students, faculty and support staff striving to create a milieu that sustains excellence. Our distinction lies in the pursuit of high academic attainment through support, encouragement, praise and motivation.
						</p>
						<p>
						Open mindedness, a multicultural orientation, independence, a global outlook, multiple intelligences and abilities â€“ these are the premium qualities needed today. I strongly believe that education is a collaborative effort that involves professional administrators, committed faculty members and motivated students. We dedicate ourselves as professional administrators in creating a dynamic education programme empowering the students in a global perspective.
We are a group of diverse experiences and outlooks, committed to excellence in preparing learners for enriched opportunities worldwide. In short, learning at AIT is a wholesome package of attitude, challenge and opportunity.						</p>
