						AIT is a proud mission driven community providing a world class education, celebrating the fact that each student is different, as a person and as a learner. I believe that powerful learning and teaching occurs under a shared spirit of respect which creates a passionate professional experience recognized for its warmth, energy and excellence.</p>
						<p>
						We foster a positive spirit and believe in partnership between students, faculty and support staff striving to create a milieu that sustains excellence. Our distinction lies in the pursuit of high academic attainment through support, encouragement, praise and motivation.
						</p>
						<p>
						Open mindedness, a multicultural orientation, independence, a global outlook, multiple intelligences and abilities – these are the premium qualities needed today. I strongly believe that education is a collaborative effort that involves professional administrators, committed faculty members and motivated students. We dedicate ourselves as professional administrators in creating a dynamic education programme empowering the students in a global perspective.
We are a group of diverse experiences and outlooks, committed to excellence in preparing learners for enriched opportunities worldwide. In short, learning at AIT is a wholesome package of attitude, challenge and opportunity.						</p>

						Apollo has emerged as a leading world class educational group that creates and disseminates knowledge, integrating advance technology. It was always a dream to build a conglomerate of institutions for quality, innovation and eminence to create graduates with knowledge and competence that can help in scripting success stories.						</p>
						<p>
						We focus on participation of our students in academics, teaching, cultural, social and physical activities to make them socially sensible all-rounder</p>
						<p><b>Let me list a few practices of Apollo that are on top of the radar:</b></p>
						<ul>
<li class="apt-2021">Leveraging the intellectual and emotional bandwidth resident here in the faculty and student community, essential to spawn tomorrow’s global leaders today.</li>
<li class="apt-2021">Ensuring an unshakable commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive community of learners, driven by values and energized by the meritocracy that marks our institute.</li>
<li class="apt-2021">Sustaining an open and transparent culture that stokes curiosity at every turn, encourages collaboration and gets the best out of every student.</li>
<li class="apt-2021">Preparing students for the complex world that they will face when they leave the portals of this vaunted institute leveraging our close linkages with industry, the Government and of course the academia. A complex world where they will have to take a position, express opinion, shape it and lead to make it a better place.</li>
<li class="apt-2021">Building a responsive and powerful community of alumni in India and abroad who are global names to reckon with and are engaged meaningfully with the institute.</li>
</ul>

						Through the efforts of our accomplished faculty, our talented students and exceptional alumni, we have been able to make rapid progress on our path of continuous growth and innovation. These accreditations and recognitions make us confident that we can be among the best institutions in the India by 2030.						</p>
						<p>
						AIT is committed to nurturing leaders and entrepreneurs who will empower their organizations in the global economy. At the same time, the Institute remains deeply rooted in the region and the nation. An underlying priority is to instill in our students a sense of commitment as managers to have a socially responsible impact; to give them an understanding of how difficult and challenging this often can be; and to expand their knowledge and their intellectual horizons so they emerge transformed and prepared to have an impact on the world of business and society at large. We have consciously created a culture that values collegiality and accessibility, with open doors at all levels.</p>
						<p>
						On the bedrock of our core values, we will continue to scale up over the next decade to build a management institute of international repute.						</p>
